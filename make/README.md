# Make practice

1. Select and document a concept.
2. Write a test to demonstrate the concept.
3. Produce the needed source and makefile to exercise that concept.


## Structure of a makefile

> Learning the dependency graph created by make.

[x] `executable` is created from dependencies.
[x] `executable` displays correct mtimes.
[x] mtime change triggers rebuild.
